Project Title: Predicting House Prices through RandomForestRegressor 

Objective The goal was to construct a predictive model to estimate the value of a house using several features of the house based on linear regression.

Key Stages of Implementation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Initial exploration was performed to get acquainted with the dataset and identify the presence of missing values. Each feature’s distribution was analyzed alongside its relationship with other features utilizing visual tools such as histograms and correlation heat maps.

Data Preprocessing and Normalization I standardized the dataset to ensure that all features contributed equitably to the model, by bringing all features to the same measurement scale as a prior step to building the predictive model.

Model Building Using the Linear Regression algorithm from the Scikit-learn library, I developed a model that predicts the housing prices based on the supplied features.

Model Evaluation The performance of the model was evaluated using R² Score, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE which are standard evaluation metrics.

Model Interpretation Interpreted the regression model by making analysis of the regression coefficients along with vis-a-vis the actual and predicted values that were plotted.
